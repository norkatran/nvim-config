# Mode changes

- run tests -> add failures to quickfix
- Method for maintaining context/targets
  - Find recent TODO comments in code?
  - A scratchpad keyed by repo/branch?
- A way to utilise Amazon Q (codecompanion.nvim?)
- [x] Browser shortcuts (i.e. opening an input and using `!j CID-520` to open a jira ticket)
- Spotify picker/display
- Emails? (unlikely)
- Slack? (unlikely)
- Fish support?
  - Running :Fish <command>
  - Running highlighted commands with `:'<,'>Fish`
- Add more 'modes'
  - Support for tests/psalm/etc ?
    - Ability to run them in docker??
- Declare system dependencies upfront
  - like { :brew { :fennel :rg } } etc. to have them auto-installed
- Hideable but persistent terminal(s) that could be pre-configured in advance and toggled via shortcuts
  - for example, setting up an amazon q session that opens with <leader>g but persists when hidden


  [x] Remap: tap <Capslock> to <esc>, hold <Capslock> to <ctrl>
  [x] rebind <leader>$ keys for nvim stuff
  [x] rebind <leader><leader>$ keys for external stuff
